This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.Â  The family had
recently hired a new, young general manager.Â  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent
company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.Â

Transitional Vocation
In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.Â  I was owner of income
properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.Â  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for
drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.Â  Within six months, all units
were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.Â  
In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment
complex.Â  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I
heard while marketing existing floor plans.Â  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a
long waiting list.Â  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely
gratifying.Â  I continued in this position to the end of construction.Â  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a
Residential Property Management Certificate.
My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design. Â
