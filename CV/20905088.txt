Core Accomplishments
Project Management:
â€¢Implemented a monitoring project reporting project comparing projected project cost to actual project cost with the purpose to provide
management information concerning effect on projected margins. This resulted in margins increasing from 
3% average to
 
18% 
average.
â€¢Successful developed 
and Implemented an 
inventory control 
software that reduced yearly expenditures by 
$500,000 
and on hand inventory
by 
$750,000
â€¢
 Reorganized
 
finishing and distribution 
operation into a team/group operation, which resulted in decrease in cost by 
20% -30%.

With major responsible was establishing the bill of material structure including direct labor hour calculation from CAD drawing and motion
time analysis to determine the different level of cost factors in the manufacturing process.
With extensive experience in the analysis of the production process to determine actual cost I was able to generate monitoring devise to
report activity concerning margin fluctuation.
Experience in developing and operating systems to monitoring and establish material with usage of a MRP system.
I also developed project progress reporting comparing projected project cost to actual project cost to monitor and provide management
information of progress effect on project margins.
This included electrical components, steel fabricated component, and tooled components based of Cad draws and regulator standards.
Proposed and implemented lean manufacturing techniques and continuous improvement manufacturing concepts training to improve turns
and reduce manufacturing cost.
Also imitated a $500,000 interest free loan from the rural development community to provide capital for expansion in production capacity.As a result the cost control and reporting margins increased from 3% average to 18% average.
