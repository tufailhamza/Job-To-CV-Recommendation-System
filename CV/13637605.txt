Personal Information
Where I have worked or studied I have always done my best to be efficient and 
excel in anything and everything I've done. I work extremely well
with others, I do 
my best to be a leader and not a follower and I try my hardest to be kind and 
respectful to anyone and everyone I come in
contact with. I am an exceptional 
writer, I am very detailed oriented and I am great at following directions and 
staying organized. Even on my bad
days I know how to keep a smile on my face 
and leave my personal problems at home to give customers a great expirience 
and keep hem coming
back for more.
