Accomplishments
Building an Organization to handle 5 year Â tank plans
Leveled out our current 5 year Tank plan
Building a 10 year strategic plan to standardize reporting
Instituted 3 week look aheads for leveling out manpower and head count control, which resulted in significant cost control measures.
2008-2010: Managed Off-Site Battery Limits Projects, which included site clearing for the construction of four new units within the Valero
Benicia Refinery. I was an Operations Supervisor with a vast track record of running safe and successful T/A's for the previous 10 years.
Volunteered to take on a lead role as a team player, to improve my knowledge and experience, and trained for this position, having
managed so may T/A's, squats and previous unit emergencies. Handled very large workloads with success. Previous T/A management with
head counts (200 employees). Effectively managed construction crews of various trades during our VIP Project with head counts of 500
construction employees, supervisors and managers in parallel. Executed work managing supervisors from VLO/Eichleay/Harvest Eng. To
successfully complete the project. Systematically closed out all projects per refinery standard procedures/ turnover packages. The project
began with and included the following
Safety: Standardized our Site Safety Plan. The Safe Plan template was designed to ramp up and down to follow the VIP Project
schedule/headcount. Safety Plan encompassed the VIP OSBL Project, Butamer ISBL Project, FBS OSBL/ISBL Project, and provisions
for the new H2 plant. Safety Teams for each of these project utilized my plan to help ensure the Safety of all construction crews
Construction: Successfully managed all Outside Battery Limits (OSBL)/ Inside Battery Limits (ISBL) projects, FGS OSBL, Utilities
Upgrades, and the H2 unit prep. Volunteered to assume the role of Butamer Mechanical Coordinator (ISBL), as my workload lightened up.
Already heavily involved in the construction phases of all projects, and familiar with the crews coming on board, so it made sense
Successfully managed Union and Non-Union crews on the same jobsite without any mentions of strikesExperience
