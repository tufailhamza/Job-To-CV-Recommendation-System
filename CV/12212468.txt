Summary
Highly motivated Civil Engineer with 16 years of experience working for one of North America's largest and most respected construction and
engineering organizations with revenues of more than $11 billion and consistently ranking among the top five contractors by Engineering News-
Record.
My experience with Kiewit has prepared me to successfully plan and execute projects while promoting safety, quality, schedule, and cost
performance. My career experience ranges from construction design coordinator on a multi billion dollar design build project, to on-site project
engineering and project management for self-performing heavy civil construction work ranging from $545 million to $3.1 million dollars. Excellent
communicator skilled in construction means and methods, cost controls, scheduling, claims analysis and contract administration.
As the Field Engineer and Project Controls Manager on one of the largest design-build project in Maryland she manages approximately 1,000
WBS activities on a P6 schedule. Even after a six month delay in the award of the project the project will be substantially complete on the original
completion date. Clara coordinates on a daily basis, incoming and outgoing correspondence, a cost loaded CPM, RFIs, modifications, change
orders, and unforeseen field conditions that required redesign and schedule modifications to adhere to a hard completion date.
