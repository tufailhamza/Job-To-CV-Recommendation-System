Every two weeks, new shipments came in with new and old chargers that we were to repair and put together before the next shipment came
in.

Still, if it works with my schedule and they need an emergency nanny, I'll be there for them.
Started at either 7am or 10am, ended at either 7pm or later if they had a date night.
They have two little boys.
Ryan (age 2) and Nathan (age 5) On the way to work for Kelly, she would drop off Nathan at pre-school.
I would watch/care for Ryan until 11:30, then I got him ready to get in the car to go pick up big brother from school on Bellevue way.
When we got back from picking up Nathan, I would feed them lunch.
Made them dinner.
Made sure they had good hygiene.
They weren't allowed much screen time (television or online games, etc.) so we mostly did critical thinking activities such as reading and
writing and art.

Put the boys to sleep at night.
Watched over their house & fed their cat when they went on long vacations.
