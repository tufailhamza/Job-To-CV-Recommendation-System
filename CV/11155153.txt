As a member of the Research and Technology team, I was able to be a part of several projects focused on saving the company money by
reducing down time of equipment, use of tested and approved quality parts and material.
Designs were developed with the use of Creo Parametric 2.0, Windchill and Autodesk Inventor 2015.
Designed, tested and implemented a pneumatic circuit to insure proper conditions existed prior to engaging and dis-engaging the clutch on
the Frac pump units.
This circuit protects the clutch from premature failure and unnecessary ware.
Investigated Fluid End failures and corrected drawing errors related to seat angel.
This significantly increased the life of the Fluid Ends.
Created approved source control drawings for the fluid end valves and seats witch eliminated the use of misaligned seat and premature
washouts of the fluid ends.
Designed a cross unit manifold used to connect up to twenty two (22) Frac Pumps to run off natural gas or field gas.
This significantly reduced fuel cost across the fleet of Frac pumps.
Troubleshot and redesigned the hydraulic circuit on the fleets sand conveyers.
This redesign significantly reduced down time and reduced the amount of training needed for field hands.
Troubleshot and redesigned the hydraulic circuit on a potential venders sand conveyor to correct an issue they were not able to correct.
This redesign involved changing the spool in the PVG valve and installing a cross port relief valve and some re-plumbing of the hydraulic
circuit.
Troubleshot and corrected the spillage of sand from the sand conveyors.
This reduced the amount of down time related to sand cleanup and removal.
Designed a dust control system for the company's fleet of sand kings.

As a member of the Coil Tubing Unit (CTU) team, I help to ensure our design and manufactured products meet the rigorous industry
standards established by the American Petroleum Institute and the International Standards Organization by the use of 3D parametric model
generation and manipulation using Autodesk Inventor Pro 2012 (Routed Systems - Tube and Pipe) and Autodesk Vault Professional 2102.
Create weight distribution analysis as well as present findings and able to defend assumptions.
CTU trailer layout redesigned to eliminate costly manufacturing rework, errors and confusion.
Hydraulic Wet Kit assembly and frame design.
Heavy and light structural frame design and aluminum mounting platform design.
Capable of setting up 3D models for use with the integrated Autodesk stress analysis FEA with the understanding of setting the
convergence, material, constraints and loads with the ability to interpret hot spots and make adjustments to the model.
Have knowledge of, and can apply, the use of section modulus tables to determine how one shape compares to another in strength for a
directional load Able to research possible problems with material selection or component interface and present options.
Vendor/Purchasing Q &A sit-in's for second sourcing prospects.
Direct and indirect interaction with customer regarding additional customer supplied hardware installations.
Take initiative to procure data (research) and make contacts in order to bring viable solutions to the forefront.

Applied Aerodynamics Inc. is a FAA/EASA Repair Station and is focused on, but not limited to, Repair / Overhaul / Manufacturing of flight
control surfaces and aircraft composites.
I was responsible for the planning of incoming repair orders for aviation parts and for repair station planning and work instruction for aircraft
components from minor skin repairs to complete rib, skin and spar replacement.
As Planning Engineer I also created and developed internal procedures and assured compliance to the D1-51991 Digital Product Definition(DPD) for Boeing Suppliers.
The successful on-sight Boeing DPD audit allowed Applied Aerodynamics to begin downloading, receiving, and/or using DPD data for
manufacturing and repair of Boeing parts.
I interact with contracts, customer service, engineering, purchasing and internal fabrication shops.
I would review orders and procedures for process improvements.
As Planning Engineer I was also heavily involved in the Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) development at Applied Aerodynamics.
Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) is an approval granted by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to a manufacturer
of aircraft parts.

AeroParts Manufacturing and Repair is focused on sheet-metal detail parts, assemblies and drop-hammer stampings.
The FAA/EASA Repair Station overhauls metal and fiberglass ducting for large commercial aircraft.
As Sr. Planner I was responsible for the planning of all incoming production orders for new aviation parts and for repair station planning and
work instruction for aircraft components.
I interact with contracts, customer service, engineering, purchasing and internal fabrication shops.
I would review orders and procedures for process improvements.
I would ensure that all customer requirements are verified in existing orders and reviewed in new orders before releasing to subsequent
operations.
I reviewed all job folders, customer requirements and developed a plan to have the parts manufactured based on the contractual
requirements.
I would develop a "Master Shop Traveler" by: Inputting information per purchase order and/or drawing.
Assign a "task number" (traveler number).
Input manufacturing instructions, sequences, and inspection points as required.
Input Specifications, verification and testing needs, etc.
into job costing system.
Create and print the shop traveler.
As Senior Manufacturing Planner I would release shop traveler to production /stores for issuance of product, material(s), and/or tooling
required to begin production flow.
I would also Review completed travelers for "approved" change(s) made during production.
Categorize required change(s) has either "one-time deviation only" or "required on future production".
If change(s) are "required for future production" then enter change(s) into system and forward that information to the contract department
for pricing adjustments on future sales.
I was also responsible for conduct technical and estimating support by researching and reviewing work order requirements as requested by
Production, Quality, and/or Management as well as providing lead-time estimates, manufacturing methods, historical planning information,
etc.
