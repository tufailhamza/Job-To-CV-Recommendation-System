DIRECTOR FINANCE AND FP&A
Executive Profile
I'm a senior finance leader who thrives when working closely with the executive team in removing obstacles to directing the company beyond
targeted growth. Early in my career I learned the value of looking beyond how things are currently done in order to continually search for how we
can do things better. Working in cooperation with senior leadership throughout the organization, my finance teams are built with this focus and the
results are enhanced analytics and dynamic reporting tools.

Engaged with four companies over this period ranging from Granite City Electric a small, family-owned company to Staples, Sun Life
Financial and Saint Gobain; I was brought in to hold interim senior finance roles and work closely with the executive teams through periods
of transition.

Even with robust ERP systems in place at Staples, the need to bridge various stand-alone systems was identified and I created an inventory
database to track existing store assets while enabling real-time "what-if" analysis and cost planning related to proposed changes improving
efficiency and predictive capabilities.
With multiple global ERP systems in place at Saint Gobain, the executive team was looking for a dynamic and robust "one-stop", menu-
driven reporting tool that I created utilizing Business Objects, advanced Excel and VBA increasing analytical capabilities and key metric
analysis.

A $1B comprehensive provider of wireless communications and software solutions to the healthcare, government, large enterprise and
emergency response sectors, Originally hired as an Assistant Controller, I experienced substantial professional growth achieving three
promotions culminating in overseeing the global finance team including accounting, financial reporting and analysis while working closely with
the Executive management team.
Major Achievements:.Working with the Engineering and Technical Operations teams I created lease and licensing database solutions in order to maintain FCC
regulatory compliance saving the company $1.2M in penalties and fines.
Through acquisition the company was operating 13 individual billing systems and the ability of senior management to make timely business
decisions was hampered by a slow consolidation's process.
With the focus on closing the books and producing standard reporting, meaningful analysis was an after-thought.
In order to provide the leadership team with better tools I established a database solution mapping each individual billing system to my data
warehouse with an export into Lawson that allowed for a timely and accurate close in less than five days.
