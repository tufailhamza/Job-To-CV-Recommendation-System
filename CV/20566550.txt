Achievements.
Collaborated with a team of engineers of different fields with the goal of creating technical solutions for product concerns raised by
customers and produced test record documentation containing solutions for customers.
Contacted customers directly to verbally convey test result and explain solution procedure along with the written documentation.
Successfully independently scoped business opportunities through technically analysing possible options and presented information to the
company Director.
Independently and autonomously researched FAR regulations to successfully create test record sheets containing correct load values and
test methodology for structural load testing on seats in aeromedical transport vehicles.
Quickly learned about production article conformity procedures taught by CASA regulatory authorities and applied knowledge and
techniques to autonomously measure articles with appropriate measuring equipment and tools in strict timeframes.
Reported nonconformities and provided recommendations for modifications directly to the design engineer.
Built, tested and verified products through performing functional and qualitative inspections to discover faults and issues in production
articles.
Deduced failure modes in items that undergo structural load testing using problem solving skills and analytical skills using Finite Element
ANSYS software.
Independently created equipment supports that are integrated on safety barriers through analytical and CAD-assisted design and through
construction using mechanical engineering methods, tools and equipment.
Desoldered and soldered electronic components onto circuit boards to rapidly create multiple fully functioning LED lights used in electronic
medical equipment.Sales Representative
