Summary
Having worked as the Construction Project Manager for diverse healthcare construction projects with budgets over $20 million, I am confident

in charge of all phases of the design and construction process for construction or refurbishment projects. While my on-the-job experience has
afforded me a well-rounded skill set, including strengths in planning and negotiation, I also excel at meeting project milestones.
