MANAGER
Summary
As a recent college graduate with a degree in psychology and a miner in business I posses over 5 years of experience in various fields and
customer service management. Throughout the years I have undertaken several jobs positions and internships. These placements have enabled me
to develop not only specific industry experience, but also valuable and transferable skill sets in the fast-paced sector of management, marketing,
and public relations. Being an exceedingly motivated, and astute individual, I seek to apply my current skill sets, some of which are strong
visualization skills, communications, leadership and organizational skills to the rewarding field of event planning. Where I can bring my zealous,
strategic values.
