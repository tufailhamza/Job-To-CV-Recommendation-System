Worked with a team of four people in UCSD's MAE 3 class to build a mobile robot.
Evaluated parts of the robot using components such as springs, high-speed motor, and geared motor Analyzed and assessed progress of the
project by using a Gantt chart Directed the group in the areas of design process and concept generation Energy Analysis Determined the
mobility of the robot by estimating the energy and power transfer that occurs from the motor to the wheels of the robot Calculated the
torque on the wheels, friction force of the floor, and other values such as factor of safety and desired time of travel AutoCAD Software
Utilization Developed drawings of a clock and archived CAD files and drawing documents Implemented the CAD files into the Lasercamm
(Laser Cutter) and produced the designed clock made of acryli Reporting/Grading Worked as an Academic Employee (Grader) for
UCSD's MAE 105 class Communicated the graded results to the professor and expressed them through histograms by Microsoft Excel
Assist in the assembly and manufacture of prototypes Utilize manufacturing methods, fabrication, and product designs Design and detail
prototypes using SolidWorks Research and analyze customer design proposals, specifications, and other data.
