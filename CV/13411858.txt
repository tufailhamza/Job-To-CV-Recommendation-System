Our goal, as a Concierge, was to create a positive, service-oriented, classy, and
FUN environment for the guests of our 875-room property! My goal was to make sure each guest felt right at home, as if they WERE home. It
was important that the solution to each and every guest request or challenge was perceived as truly 
easyÂ 
 to make happen. Â I encouraged my
team to bring "the 
Wow
 ! factor" to life; to (ideally) hear every guest reply with a "Wow!" when they heard that their request had been completed!
Â It truly was an entertaining, outside-of-the-box-thinking, creative solution seeking job!

Raised in an entrepreneurial family, I opened my own dance and
tumbling school at 18. I researched prime location options, formulated a vision and successful business plan that I implemented on my own.
Â Thirty students quickly skyrocketed to hundreds (both youth and adults). Â My ability to interact with my clients in a courteous and positive
manner secured their loyalty and patronage. This business venture put me thru college and made me a substantial income. Â At 28, when ready to
retire from teaching, I marketed and "sold" my clientele to another local dance school for a truly substantial profit.

Living in a rural community, residents
were dependent on our volunteer fire department for all medical and fire emergencies until other paid departments could arrive. After watching my
grandmother pass away because no one in our family was capable of providing CPR, I realized I needed to step up and joined our local Volunteer
Fire Department. I completed EMT training at Miramar College, and then a 12-week National Fire Academy, where I was one of only 4 womento pass. Â It was truly the most physically challenging endeavor I've ever completed, but certainly one I am incredibly proud of! Â I served as a
volunteer Firefighter/EMT on the San Diego Rural Fire Department for 4 years.
