PASTRY CHEF /SERVER
Summary
My main goal is to ensure that procedures are followed for seating and serving guests. 
Make sure that all staff act in a way that promotes guest
satisfaction and handle any issues or complaints. 
It will be my pleasure to design and implement training for servers, bussers, hosts, baristas, and
bartenders:L this training will involve raining on menu items, as well as "shadowing" other servers to learn the restaurant's procedures and
standards. 
additionally, I will work side by side with the kitchen manage rand team to assist with the restaurant's cost controls by helping develop
systems to manage product waste, labor costs, and breakage. 
Also I will oversee the facility upkeep, ensuring that the front of house areas are
clean and meet restaurant standards while arranging that repairs are made in a timely manner and I will facilities maintenances needed.
