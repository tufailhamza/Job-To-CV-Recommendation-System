Personal Information
Fair play golfer, reading, learning and communicating. I have other interest outside of golf such as horses, traveling and other outdoor activities. Jet
skiing, outdoor lunches with spouse, and too many things to want to do with little or no time to do them. Outgoing energetic and fun to be around.
In a business setting I am the type to roll up the sleeves and grab the task at hand. Due to my military background I am able to make quick
decisive decisions and work under stress. 
I am currently looking for the next career move in life and will embrace it energetically for the right
employer. I am trainable and still strive to learn at least one thing every day.
