A beginner job out of high school that I enjoyed and am glad I had the opportunity to work here.
It was a face paced job that challenged me in many aspects of the food industry.
Health and safety with food were very important factors for the tasks at hand.
Learning and applying health department codes were a challenge, but I feel I gained knowledge about different avenues of this business.

Summary
My name is Evan Elias, I have recently made the important decision about my career. Computers are going fast and the world of computers is
expanding to all the corners of the earth. I want to be part of this ever-evolving staple of humanity. I also want to be able to cook and provide for
people who cannot do it themselves and be a contributor to technology in my course of life. I have taken many classes on programming and taught
myself about the IT aspect of computers. I am very strong in math and I like to solve problems. I have taken many cooking classes and have
worked in every position in a kitchen.
Highlights
I am very good under pressure from the experiences in the restaurant industry. I am very good with
Technology whether it be solving a simple internet bug or it being a big list of coding.
