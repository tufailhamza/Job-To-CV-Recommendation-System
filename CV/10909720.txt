Extra-Curricular ActivitiesI ran the nursery at my church for a yea and then taught Sunday school for the older kids for another two years .
I also helped run an after school "get your homework done here" program the community started where kids that didn't have help at home could
come to us and get help with their homework or for the younger children the parents could enroll them and they would come daily after school.
