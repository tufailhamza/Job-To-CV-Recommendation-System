Core Accomplishments
Manufacturing Lead in Labor Negotiations resulting in a multi-million dollar benefit to the company across the term of the agreement, once
ratified.
Changed Marinette Marine Module Construction from a static build process to a dynamic build process resulting in schedule attainment and
a productivity improvement from 50% to 100%. Â The resulting cost improvement has netted savings of $5M per ship.
Lead, Designed, Constructed and Operated a new Module Facility resulting in achievement of baseline schedules and operations at
budgeted cost. Â Achieved this despite many claims that the process design would never work and it would cost us more to operate in this
fashion.
Helped grow a small, privately owned company from $8M in revenue to $20M in revenue in a very competitive market. Â Performed this
through Lean engagement, Customer Involvement, Employee involvement and drive to achieve the goals we collectively set.

Systems are complete and prepared for the next stage of final construction and System testing.
Span of control includes 4 ships in various stages of construction, oversight of over 600 Union employees and 42 Area Managers, General
Foremen and Foremen.
Insuring that all Outfitting is done in its sequenced Stage of Construction.
In June 2014, our completion rate of modules prior to module erection was roughly 65%. Â It is now in the high 90 percentile and averages
97%.
My Team raised the bar for the level of completion at the time of launch. Â Prior ships launched at a level of mid - low 70 percentile, while
LCS 9 launched at 84% complete and therefore re-gaining schedule for an on-time delivery.
This level of completion earned the Team significant accolades from the customer along with the company earning a multi-million dollar
incentive bonus for achieving this goal
Introduced status boards at Work Centers to communicate performance to employees.
Additionally, we post safety alerts on status boards when accidents occur and speak to each of our crews to insure we are adhering to safe
practices and alerting Leadership when they see a problem.

StateAccountable for the Construction of Modules for LCS vessels.
Responsible for the following; Structure, Pipe Fabrication, Outfitting of equipment and Electrical foundations, short and long term manning
plans, and cost and schedule performance.
The Structural Trade (Steel and Aluminum) was performing at 50% productivity and losing schedule each day. Â Additionally, the team was
disjointed and not working as a cohesive unit.
Throughout the transition from poor performance to exceptional performance, I accomplished the following: 
1) Immediately cut manning in
the Steel Module department from 167 down to 127, with immediate improvement in cost performance and no degradation in schedule.
Â 2) Continued to reduce manning through attrition and the elimination of contract employees to achieve on budget cost performance. Â 3)
Once stabilized, schedule performance began to improve until the group was back on baseline schedule and improvements began to happen
daily. Â 4) Built a solid Team that has continued to improve and is currently operating with 70 employees as opposed 167 and continues to
gain schedule and make improvements.
Spearheaded the introduction and implementation of Lean methods.
Results to date include: Implemented 5S program with great success.Everything has a place; Everything in it's place.
Implemented Lean methods in the Pipe shop that resulted in an increased throughput from 250 spools per week 
up to just over 400 spools
per week without additional manpower.
Introduced status boards at Work Centers to communicate performance to employee base.
Introduced daily tracking, progressing and daily status to each foreman in an effort to understand how we 
performed each day and what
corrections must be made to insure we meet our weekly goals.
As this group stabilized, complaints from our internal customers diminished by 75%.
This was done through open communication of the down stream issues with internal customers and a "Go and See" technique so the
foreman who performed the unacceptable work could understand how their error effected down stream operations.
Using this technique, coupled with a more clear understanding of quality procedures, quality performance improved greatly saving thousands
of hours of unnecessary rework.
Highlighting safety as the most important thing we do as a Leadership Team and working with my direct reports, we managed to create a
safer, cleaner and more organized environment, reducing accidents by 50 % in the first year.
This was accomplished through communication and implementation of 5S methods leading to eliminating potential safety hazards.

Programs for the U.S. Navy.
After commissioning of the facility, the employee base grew from 50 employees to just over 600.
Managed this transition by hiring predominantly low skilled employees and training them from B Class skill base to A Class Skill base.
Phase II (370K sq. ft.) was commissioned in mid-January of 2012.

External survey results have improved significantly vessel to vessel.
Current vessel progressing at a 90+ pass rate on first time surveys compared to roughly 75% on prior vessel.
With the new Module facility on line, we began scribing and cutting modules neat to avoid any interference when erecting module to module.Â This has allowed the erection of modules and the completion of the vessels to significantly increase.
Our safety performance is among the best in the Industry.
We have received several Industry awards for our safety performance.
This was done through a collective team effort.
